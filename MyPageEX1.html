		<td align=justify> Hi my name is Stewart Viera. I am a graduate from Essex County College. I currently attend NJIT. I wanna share with other college students information about
		a club I founded around 2 years ago. This club focuses in the training of the Korean martial art Taekwon-do. This club was founded on Spring 2011. We currently
		have a black belt 7th degree master teaching our classes. This club provides free classes 3 times a week. This club is open for any college student in the
		NJ area. Our club has a mixture of members from different level, ages, heights,races and so. This martial is great for everybody and it will teach to gain strength, discipline and responsibility.
		There are many things to consider about training Taekwon-do. There are lots of benefit that will help you throughout your college life and beyond. So what should you expect after joining this club? </td>
		
		<td align=justify> No matter your age or experience, you will participate in a fun and fulfilling workout while you learn reality based self defense that really works!


Training Taekwon-Do will give you additional benefits. Students will release stress, get in shape and understand that training the body and mind goes far beyond any other standard exercise program.

This is great for the college life, since all the work and responsibility we carry as students, we need the mental strength, and discipline to outstand all the issues college students have to deal with during the 4 years.

We hope that when you graduate from college you also take with you the achivement of becoming a black belt. what a great gift to yourself</td>
